  <h1>About Our Team</h1>
  <p>
    We are a team of data scientists passionate about leveraging deep learning techniques for medical advancements. Our project, developed as part of the Infyma Hackathon, focuses on the early detection of retinopathy using advanced machine learning algorithms. By combining cutting-edge research with practical implementation, we aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support medical professionals in making faster, more reliable decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying retinopathy at an early stage, helping reduce preventable vision loss. By utilizing deep learning models trained on high-quality medical imaging data, we strive to create a tool that assists ophthalmologists in detecting retinal abnormalities with precision and efficiency.
